Where did the image come from? 
The image came from https://www.pngegg.com/en/png-bncvh#google_vignette, its a texture of an 8ball




What lighting did you implement?
I implemented ambient and diffuse lighting to create a glowing 8-ball effect. I know that the image, if you look 
at it already has some glow, but if you remove the lighting you'll see it glows way less, and that my lighting does create
an effect on it


Did you do anything beyond basic texure with diffuse lighting (explain)?
N/A
