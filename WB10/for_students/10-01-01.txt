1. The inputs of a vertex shader are the attributes of the vertex and the uniforms. It's outputs 
are the screen-position of the vertex and new attributes to the vertices

2. The inputs of a fragment shader are the properties of the fragment, and interpolated variables from the
vertices, and the outputs are more properties of the fragment (i.e. color).
