Explain how your shader works. If your shader is based on some example, cite your source (with a link).

My shader is kind of based off the last box, 10-06-01, I copied my code to use as starter code. My shader works by taking UV coordinates,
scaling them so that the pattern is more "zoomed out", then it uses the step function to create a transition based on the distance
from the center. The part that actually creates the unique puzzle shape is the line "float isWithinCheck = step(0.16, min(0.5 - decimalU, distanceFromEdge))".
Basically it checks if the distance from the edge is â‰¥ 16, this makes the middle chunk look inverted, the left side goes out and the right side is pulled inward, since that
is the value in step() that determines the boundary where step will transition.
