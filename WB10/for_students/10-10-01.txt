Where did you get your shader? Describe the source and include a link.
I got my shader from https://shaderfrog.com/app/editor, it is from ShaderFrog and it 
was created by Andrew Ray.



In your own words, describe how this shader works. (3-5 sentences)

The shader works by using the uniforms time, resolution (like size), intensity,
speed, and colors for the design aspect / timing of the shader. it has what's called the
circuit function that basically creates the pattern of the moving light by using
transformations that use the time variable and the speed variable as well as the position given
by the uvs. it calcuates the color based on the time / circuit output so that it looks like the color
is moving - changes over time because of the time variable that we pass in.
