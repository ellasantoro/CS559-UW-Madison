Explain what your shader does and how it works.
My shader uses an image for the texture, and it has specular and diffuse lighting. It also has light tan colored
dots along the shape (a pattern with the image) that make the planet look more real with imperfections. The user can use
the slider to change how many dots are reflected on the planet. There are also three light shaders that affect the direction
of the light (x,y, and z). Animation is not done in the shader.
