Answer the question.
We know that this is right because of the way the light is hitting the top.
If it was only using the specular that we changed to white, there would be no yellow
in this. It would just be white fading into black.

On the other hand, if we just had diffuse, it would be just yellow fading into black with a more rigid fade, and matte-like
texture (while the specular is more like a shiny texture). Combining them makes it look like there is yellow
fading into black with a light shining down on it.
