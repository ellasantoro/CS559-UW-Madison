[X] correct P1G Canvas Assignment submission on time [none]: 
[X] Drawing the track as a single simple curve (cardinal spline) that interpolates the control points [tr-01-01]: 
[X] Train goes around the track correctly ('evenly in parameter space' - continuous looping motion) [tr-01-01]: 
[X] The interface still works (the track can be moved and the run slider works, even while the train is in motion) [tr-01-01]: 
[X] Train has a front [tr-01-01]: The semicircle in the front indicates the front of the train
[X] Train points in the right direction as it goes around the track [tr-01-01]: 
[X] Train direction and motion is correct even as points are added/removed [tr-01-01]: 
[X] Default track configuration shows off arc length (train should speed up and slow down if arc length parameterization is turned off or not implemented) [tr-01-01]: 
[ ] Arc Length parameterization (train goes at a relatively constant speed as it goes around the track, no matter what the control point spacing is). You must add a checkbox to turn this on and off. This one is hard, but it enables several of the other things, so it is actually worth a lot [tr-01-01]: 
[X] Rail Ties drawn perpendicular to track [tr-01-01]:  I drew my rail ties perpendicular to the track.
[X] Rail Ties drawn with correct spacing (this is simple once you have arc-length [tr-01-01]:  I used a similar method from WB5 to space my rail ties.
[ ] Parallel rails [tr-01-01]: 
[ ] Multiple cars all of them centered on the track [tr-01-01]: 
[ ] Multiple cars that are fixed distance apart) [tr-01-01]: 
[ ] Trucked wheels (requires keeping the pairs of wheels the correct distance apart and on the track, and having the train car positioned appropriately - this is only for people who are into trains and appreciate this detail) [tr-01-01]: 
[ ] Slider to control tension [tr-01-01]: 
[ ] Switchable B-Splines [tr-01-01]: 
[X] Smoke [tr-01-01]: I added smoke emitting from the top of the train that trails off.
[X] Scenery [tr-01-01]: For scenery, I have trees and flowers around the canvas.
[ ] Scenery adapts to the track [tr-01-01]:
